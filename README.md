# Iceberg for KUMALEON
Syntax highlighting demonstration of [Iceberg](https://cocopon.github.io/iceberg.vim/), a text editor theme originally for Vim.  Suitable for the texture of [KUMALEON](https://kumaleon.com/).

This sketch uses the code of the sketch itself for visualization. Additionally, it changes its color to match the system environment... like a chameleon.
